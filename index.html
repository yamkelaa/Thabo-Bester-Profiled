          <article class="paragraphs one writing">
            Thabo Bester was born to Maria Mabaso on the 13th of June 1986 at
            Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. She was only 16 at the
            time and this was her first child, in various interviews she details
            how Thabo was conceived through rape and because this was such a
            traumatic experience for her she was understandably unable to
            identify his father and reluctant to look for him, however members
            of her community allege he is a local Portugese Shopkeeper who bears
            a striking resemblence to Thabo.

            Upon his birth a young Maria did take care of Thabo until he was a
            about a year old upon which she left him in the care of her mother,
            Thabos grandmother in order to go and find work. During this time
            she also considered giving Thabo up for adoption, as an Indian
            family form Lenasia had asked to raise him, but she decided against
            it as she felt sure he was going to be a good child.

            Upon being given to his grandmother Johanna Bester, Thabo was raised
            in a small farming community called Eikenhof. According to Thabo his
            childhood was extremely difficult, he felt abandoned by his mother
            and described being sexually abused mutliple times, first by a man
            his grandmother was seeing, and second by a stranger who had offered
            him shelter when he had run away from home.

            Thabo Bester attended Laerskool Danie Theron situated in the South
            of Johannesburg from 1997 at the age of eleven, before eventually
            dropping out during the third term of his seventh grade. It was then
            that he began his criminal career, he would pretend to be a
            destitute high school student in need of shelter and a home and
            would go on to receive food, clothes and even a cellphone from his
            unsuspecting victims, one of whom later spotted him in a mall
            appearing well off, and dressed to the nines, a far contradiction
            from the boy who they had previously picked up after seeing him
            stand by the side of the road asking for a lift home. He eventually
            moved into one of his victimâ€™s homes later serving jail time after
            being convicted for stealing from them on numerous occasions.

            identified by his criminal record as he had no birth certificate
            began building a criminal enterpise, setting up a facebook page
            where he pretended to be a well-respected scout, with a host of
            international clients who needed up and coming models. He would
            later communicate to young women on the platform, offer them a
            photoshoot and proceed to rape and rob them upon their arrival. In
            other instances he would book hotels and professional photgraphers,
            with the assistance of fake proof of payments, orchastrate elaborate
            shoots and whilst the models and photographers were at lunch tafeoff

            guesthouse where she and Bester were staying at for a short

            wake her up, before making off with her belongings. He was later

            Burnt Beyond Recognition: On the 3rd of May 2022, the Department of
            Correctional Services released a statement notifying the public that

            <p class="article-content writing">
              In a shocking turn of events, Thabo Bester, who was believed to
              have died by suicide according to the Department of Correctional
              Services, was spotted at Sandton City alongside Dr. Nandipha
              Magudumana, a well-known doctor and aesthetician, and her two
              children. This sighting, which occurred approximately a year after
              Bester's reported death, caused a global sensation as the image
              circulated on Twitter. The unexpected reappearance of Bester and
              his association with Dr. Magudumana sparked widespread speculation
              and curiosity. Shortly after the sighting in question, the duo
              went on the run, leaving behind their luxurious Hyde Park
              residence, dropping off Magudumanas children at school and taking
              refuge in a motel before crossinf the border. However, their
              escape was short-lived as they were eventually apprehended in
              Tanzania, thanks to a joint effort by law enforcement agencies.
              The subsequent return to South Africa under heavy police guard and
              the legal proceedings thereafter only added to the intrigue
              surrounding this extraordinary case. Bester was transported to
              Kgosi Mampuru C-Max Prison while Dr. Magudumana was remanded in
              police custody and faced charges in the Bloemfontein Magistrates
              Court on the same day.

              Upon their apprehension, shocking details about Bester's escape
              and Magudumana's assistance in this regard began to emerge,
              causing international uproar, parliamentary debates, and an
              irreversible breakdown in the relationship between the Department
              of Correctional Services and G4S, the company hired to manage the
              prison from which Bester had escaped. Eyewitness accounts,
              confessions from accomplices, and a daring statement from Bester's
              former cell-mate painted a vivid picture of an audacious escpae.
              Prior to his alleged suicide, Bester had shared with fellow
              inmates that he was in high spirits as he was soon to leave. He
              was later found burnt beyond recognition in his jail cell after an
              explosion had occurred. It was later revealed that he had in fact,
              hired prison guards to place a dead body in his cell, start a fire
              ,pretend not to notice until it was too late, disable CCTV
              cameras, and walk him out of the prison in G4S uniform into the
              welcoming arms of his girlfriend, Dr. Nandipha Magudumana.

              DNA tests later revealed that the body found burnt beyond
              recognition in Besters cell, was that of 31-year-old Katlego
              Bereng. Authorities were further puzzled when it was revealed that
              Bereng had actually passed on from blunt force trauma to the head.
              What added to the intrigue was the fact that he was acquainted
              with one of the accomplices involved in Besters' brazen escape
              just two months prior to his disappearance in March 2022. Sadly,
              more victimes are said to have fallen prey to Bester and
              Magudumans elaborate schemes, the helper and gardener who had been
              employed at the residence where Magudumana and Bester resided
              shelter after his escape seemed to vanish into thin air. Their
              families grew increasingly frantic in their search for them, but
              they were never found. Police have strong suspicions that they may
              have been buried in the yard of the Hyde Park mansion where they
              worked, a chilling possibility that only deepens the mystery
              surrounding this perplexing case.

            Perhaps one of the most shocking aspects within the Thabo Bester
            saga is the involvement of famed medical doctor and CEO of a popular
            aesthetics suite, Dr. Nandipha Magudumana. The world watched in
            shock as her involvement, which included regularly seeing Bester in
            prison allegedly for conjugal visits while she was married,
            organizing multiple dead bodies to facilitate false insurance
            claims, and insisting Bester was her husband and that she wanted his
            body cremated immediately after his death, were laid bare. Questions
            began to arise: Why would a young, successful doctor married to
            another doctor with two girls risk it all for a convicted murderer
            and primary school dropout?
